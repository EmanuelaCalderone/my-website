            "“It is not the strongest or the most intelligent who survives, but the one most adaptable to change.” - Charles Darwin",
        paragraph1:
            "💻 I’m a Front-end Developer with a strong attention to detail and a passion for UI/UX design. I completed an intensive Full-Stack Web Development course, focusing mainly on the Front-end - where I can best express my creativity, love for clean interfaces, and intuitive user experiences.",
        paragraph2:
            "🌍 I also have a background in the humanities and languages, which adds great value to my development work. It helped me build transferable skills such as research ability, precision, communication care, and a natural curiosity for what I don’t yet know. I turn client needs into functional and well-designed digital solutions, with an eye for detail, visual consistency, and user satisfaction. Every project is an opportunity to learn, grow, and improve - a journey of continuous evolution that combines technique, creativity, and sensitivity.",
        paragraph3:
            "💡 I believe development isn’t just about writing clean and functional code, but transforming ideas into meaningful digital experiences where logic and design come together to create real value.",
        paragraph4:
            "🤝 I enjoy working both independently and in teams, driven by constant curiosity for technology and a passion for continuous learning.",
